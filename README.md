# What is a component?

<dl>
<dd>

## Components are resuable pieces of code to create elements.
**Components are the building blocks of a React app.** In a more technical sense, a component is a JavaScript class or function that accepts inputs like props and returns a React element that describes how the section's UI will appear. At its core, components can help organize complex applications by making small, reusable pieces of code. Below is an example of the simple "component".
```JavaScript
      const myGreeting = <div>                                             
                            <h1>This is my Greeting</h1>                     
                            <p>Salutations from myself to yourself</p>
                         </div>
```

<br>

## A component can be written as a function.
When you write the component as a function, you simply return the component inside parentheses ( () ). **Note here that custom components should be upper case**
```JavaScript
      function Greeting() {
        return (
          <div>                                             
              <h1>This is my Greeting</h1>                     
              <p>Salutations from myself to yourself</p>
          </div>
        );
      };
```

<br>

## To use functional components, you can use tags or createElement.
**The first method is using tags (e.g. ```<myComponent> <myComponent />```).** Tags can be used because a React component that only accepts one element and all the rest/siblings must be nested within the one parent element.

**The second method is to use the full tags as an element (e.g. ```<myComponent><myComponent/>``` ).** This will come in handy when you start nested elements later on.

**The third method is to use the ```React.createElement(myComponent)``` method.** When you use this method, you simply pass in the component name (i.e. Greeting).
```JavaScript
  // Method 1: Tags:
  ReactDOM.render(< Greeting />, appRoot);
  
  // Method 2: Full tag element:
  ReactDOM.render(<Greeting><Greeting/>, appRoot);

  // Method 3: createElement method:
  ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(Greeting), appRoot);

```

# What is a prop?

<dl>
<dd>

## Props make components easily and dynamically customizable.
 **Props are the inputs (i.e. arguments) to a React component and are similar to HTML element attributes.** Props provide a way of pasing properites and data down from one component to another, typically from parent to a child component (unidirectional dataflow). In many ways, you can consider props the same as arguments to a function.  However, note that props are *read-only* and components should *never* modify props passed into it. So when a component is passed a prop as an input, it should always return the same result for the input.

<br>

## To use props in a component, use curly braces.
Inside the curly braces, you can insert JavaScript, such as variables, etc. You can also use backticks inside the curly braces as well.
```JavaScript
      const googleAddress = "https://google.com";
      const target = "_blank";

      const googleHome = (
        <a href={googleAddress} target={target}>        // curly braces for variables.
          {`Google Homepage`}                           // curly braces with backticks.
        </a>
      );

      ReactDOM.render(googleHome, appRoot);
```

<br>

## You can add id's and class attributes to output HTML.
**You can add id's and classes which are rendered into the DOM by using props.** Notice that these look very much similar to DOM attributes. However, keep in mind that there are some subtle differences in prop attributes. For example, although the "id" is the same as it is in HTML,the the prop for "class" is called "className".

```JavaScript
      function Greeting() {
        return (
          <span id='greet-id' className='greet-class'>Hello world</span>    // id and classname.
        );
      }

      ReactDOM.render(< Greeting />, appRoot);
```

<br>

## Props are function arguments.
**Props are passed to components much like the way arguments are passed into a function.** If you were to pass in a the parameter "args" and insert a console.log(args), you will get an empty object ( {} ). This object is the component's props (which we called "args") and contains the key/value pairs corresponding to the props that were passed in.

In the example below, when you render Greeting, you can also (in the same tag) pass in any arguments you want. In this case, there are no argument. However, if you console log the args you passed in (which are still nothing in this case), you will get an *empty object*. This object is what will store all the arguments you pass in to the component for you to use internally. 
```JavaScript
      const appRoot = document.querySelector("#application-root");

      function Greeting(args) {                                                              // 2. Arguments passed in as "args".
        console.log(args)                                                                    // 3. {}
        return <span id="greeting-id" className="greeting-class">My Greeting</span>;    
      }

      ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, appRoot);                                                // 1. Greeting instance with NO arguments.
```

<br>

## Pass props like arguments.
**To pass props to components, you simply pass the arguments to the empty "props" object.** Suppose you want to pass attributes from OUTSIDE the component. In the example below, when we render Greeting with ```ReactDOM.render()``` and pass in ```className="new-class-name"```, we are essentially populating the blank object in the form of key/value pairs, which in this case would be ```className: new-class-name```. 

And because you pass the props like arguments, you pass ```props``` as a parameter to Greeting and then access the key/value pair for className using dot-notation. In this case, we use the curly braces and ```props.className```.
```JavaScript
      const appRoot = document.querySelector("#application-root");                     

      function Greeting(props) {                                                             // 2. arguments passed in as "props". 
        return <span id="greeting-id" className={props.className}>My Greeting</span>;        // 3. className accesed with props.className.
      }

      ReactDOM.render(<Greeting className="new-class-name"/>, appRoot);                      // 1. Greeting instance with className argument.
```

<br>

## You can pass multiple types of data to the component.
**The types of data you can pass include strings, booleans, numbers, objects, arrays, etc.** You can do all of that when you render the instance of your component. **Also notice that except for the strings, all the values of the data types are in curly braces ({}).**
```JavaScript
      ReactDOM.render(
        <Greeting 
          className="new-class-name"           // class
          foo='bar'                            // string
          boolProp={false}                     // booleans
          numberProp={123}                     // integers
          objectProp={{ baz: 'buzz' }}         // objects
          objectProp={ bar }                   // object via const obj = {foo: 'bar'}
          functionProp={func}                  // function via const func = function(){...}
          arrayProp={[ '3', '2', '1' ]}        // array
        />, appRoot);
```

<br>

## Nesting Elements will create a prop called "children".
**When you nest other elements inside your rendered component, React will create a special object called "children".** For example, if you want to nest an ```<h1>``` element inside ```<header>```, those nested elements are stored and accessed via the "children" property. The children prop to pass nested element much like an argument to a function which React then renders to the page.

 In the following examples, you'll see how the rendered component shows in the console WITHOUT children and WITH children and how when you do have children, a special "children" property is created.

<br>

### WITHOUT nested elements, React will not provide the "children" object.
-------------
**Withough nested elements, the component will not have the children object.** In the example below, we have a basic render of the Greeting component WITHOUT any nested elements. Note that in the console, the component does NOT have a children property.
```JavaScript
      function Greeting(props) {
        console.log(props)
        return (
          <header>
            Salutations!                       // OUTPUT: Salutations!
          </header>
        );
      }

      ReactDOM.render(
        <Greeting className="my-class">        // Note that there are NO nested elements.
        </Greeting>, appRoot);
```
```
  ==========CONSOLE==========

  {className: "my-class"}
    className: "my-class"
    __proto__: Object
```

<br>

### WITH nested elements, React WILL provide the "children" object.
--------------
**React creates the "children" prop automatically and assigns its value whatever was between the open and closing of the component tags.** The children prop is enabling the h1 element to be specified *outside* the Greeting component at the exact point where we placed it.

```JavaScript
      function Greeting(props) {
        console.log(props)
        return (
          <header>
            {props.children}                   // OUTPUT: Warm Welcome!
          </header>
        );
      }

      ReactDOM.render(
        <Greeting className="my-class">
          <h1>Warm Welcome!</h1>               // h1 nested element.
        </Greeting>, appRoot);
```
```
  ==========CONSOLE==========

  {className: "my-class", children: {…}}
    className: "my-class"
    children: {$$typeof: Symbol(react.element), type: "h1", key: null, ref: null, props: {…}, …}
    __proto__: Object
```

# Why do you use components?
The advantage of using React components is that the are *reusable*. You can make a special component like a button, box, etc. and reuse them as many times as you want throughout your code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# How do you create and use a custom component?

<dl>
<dd>

## Create a composition file to store custom components.
**When you create a composition file, you create a holder for custom components.** Assuming you have your React application setup and ready to go (e.g. create-react-app), the first thing you need to do is create "composition" file inside your source files folder. This file is going to house all of the components for the immediate study.
```
  src  >  composition  
```

<br>

## Create a custom component file
**To create a custom component, simply create a .js file and name it with a capital letter.** Now that you have a composition file, you can create as many custom compents as you want and store them (and associaetd css files) for use in your application. Remember that when you do custom components, by convention you should always capitalize the first letter in the name.
```
  src  >  composition  >  MyComponent.js
```
<br>

## Setup your custom component.
**The setup for a custom component will usually have a few standard elements.** First, you need to import React so you can utilize it in your file. Second, you need to create your custom component. You component can be constructed in a few ways, such as a *function component* or a *class component*. For this example, we'll use a function component but see some of the following questions in this readme for class component composition. Note here that we have the "props" object passed in and ```{props.children}``` to get the child text. 


And lastly, you need to export your component for use elsewhere in the application.
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';                         // 1. Import react

  function MyComponent(props) {                      // 2. Custom component (with props passed in).
    return (
      <div>
        {props.children}                             // 3. Access the children via props.children.
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default MyComponent;                        // 4. Export "MyComponent" component.
```

<br>

## Import and use you custom component.
**To import a custom component, you need to import the file and then use the component name you exported.** First, you need to import the component by name and then import it from the file location. Once this is done, you can use the component anywhere in the file! In the example below, we use the ```MyComponent``` component in the App component and the result of that JSX return will be "This is a test" passed via the props object to the div element in the MyComponent component.

```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  import MyComponent from './composition/MyComponent';      // 1. Import custom component from file location. 

  function App() {
    return (
      <MyComponent>                                         // 2. Use the imported custom component.
        This is a test.                                     // 3. Text accessible via props.children.
      </MyComponent>      
    );
  }

  export default App;
```

**You can also store the component as a constant and then use it in another component.** For example, instead of cramming all the code associated with the component inside another component, you can make things cleaner by storing the component *outside* another function and then using that variable name anywhere you want inside the curly braces.
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  import MyComponent from './composition/MyComponent';    

  const UseComponent = (                                     // 1. Component stored as a const...
    <MyComponent>                             
      This is a test.            
    </MyComponent>    
  );

  function App() {
    return (
      {UseComponent}                                         // 2. Stored component used in code.
    );
  }

  export default App;
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# How do you make components configurable?

<dl>
<dd>

## Without configurability, components lack multiple uses. 

To put configurability in context, if you use a component like "MyComponent" in another like "App" in App.js, you will most likely need to access content inside the invoked component. To start off, take a look at a basic use of a component in the ```App``` component. Although this is a great example of how to use a component, you'll notice that this component only has one use.
```JavaScript 
  function Greeting() {                        // 1. "Greeting" custom component.
    return (                                   // 2. That returns the following JSX element.
      <div className="greetingStyle">
        Hello there friend!               
      </div>
    );
  }
    
  function App() {
    return (
      <Greeting />                            // 3. Greeting "Hello there friend!" text.  
    );
  }
```

## Configure components with props.
**To create a component that can be used many times over, you need to make the component configurable.** You can do this using the "props" object, which is passed to the relevant component and allows you to access any of the properties that it stores. This is useful because it allows your component to be used in many different ways. 

Consider the Greeting component above. The component as it is has one use... to say "Hello there friend!" with the associated stylings. However, if you want to use the same component with different greetings like "Howdy" or "Hiya", you would have to make completely different components for those seperate greetings. 

**To make the component configurable, you need to use the props object.** This will in turn allow children (i.e. the text "Hello there friend!") to pass via the props object to the Greeting component and back to the App component for display.  To configure the component, you simply need to pass props as a parameter of the Greeting component and then access the child "Hello there friend!" text via ```props.children```.
```JavaScript
  function Greeting(props) {                // 2. Pass the "props" object to access the child text.
    return (                             
      <div className="greetingStyle">
        {props.children}                    // 3. ... and pass child text through via props.children.
      </div>
    );
  }
    
  function App() {
    return (
      <Greeting>                            // 1. Greeting component with children text.
        Hello there friend!                 // 4. "Hello there friend!" will return via JSX.
      </Greeting>            
    );
  }
```

## You can also configure components with variables.
Variables can store such things as attributes (e.g. className, etc.)



</dd>
</dl>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# How do you style components?

<dl>
<dd>

## Create a CSS file inside the same folder as your component file.
For component styling, create a style sheet with the name of the component (or related components) in the folder you have the component in. 
For example, if you are making a CSS file for a custom component, it will be inside the composition file. 
```
  composition  >  MyComponent.css
```

## Import the CSS file to your component file
To import a css file, all you need to do is import the file directly using the "import" keyword and the file path.
```JavaScript
    import React from 'react';
    import './MyComponent.css';                      // import css file to component file.
    
    function Greeting(props) {       
    return (                             
      <div>
        {props.children}           
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default Greeting;
```

## You can also use inline styling.
To Use inline styling, you simply need to add the additional attribute to your element. Normally you would want to use className, 
but in this case, you just add the attribute with double brackets, one for the JSX insertion and the second for the css property. 
```JavaScript
    import React from 'react';
    import './MyComponent.css';    
    
    function Greeting(props) {       
      return (                             
        <div style={{ color: props.color }}>            // 1. inline style option
          {props.children}           
        </div>
      );
    }

  export default Greeting;
```

And then to add the inline styling to the component in App, simply add the "color" attribute to the special variables you 
created in the primary App component. In this case, we can add the color name or a hexcode (i.e. color='#126BCC').
```JavaScript
    const MyGreetings = (
      <Greeting color='#126BCC'>                       // 2. added color attribute.
        Hello there friend!         
      </Greeting>  
    );
    
    function App() {
    return (
       {MyGreetings}         
    );
  }
```

# How do you create and use a custom component?

<dl>
<dd>

## 1. Create a composition file.
Assuming you have your React application setup and ready to go (e.g. create-react-app), the first thing you need to do is create "composition" file inside your source files folder. This file is going to house all of the components for the immediate study.
```
  src  >  composition  
```

<br>

## 2. Create a component file in the composition folder.
Once you have the composition folder setup, you can put all of your component files inside. For this study, we want to create a component that splits the screen in two called "Split." Remember that in the case of custom components, you always want to capitalize the first letter by convention.
```
  src  >  composition  >  Split.js
```

<br>

## 3. In your component file, import React.
First, you need to make sure you import react so that you can use it inside your file. To do this, you simply need to import React from the react dependency that which comes bundled with the ```create-react-app``` application installation.
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';                         // Import React for use inside file.
```

<br>

## 4. Create a function for your component.
The function you create is going to be the custom component you want to exort elsewhere in your code.  In this case, we're going to create a component that "splits" a screen in two, so we should name it something that is intuitive like "Split". Again, remember that since this is a custom component, you want to capitalize the first letter.
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  
  function Split() {                                 // Split component.
    return (
      <div className='split'>
        This is the content of the split component.
      </div>
    );
  }
```

<br>

## 5. Export the component for use in the app.
If you want to export your component for use elsewhere in your code, you need to export it. React uses the "export" keyowrd to export a particular module, named parameter, etc. To export the default export from a file, you follow the following syntax:
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  
  function Split() {
    return (
      <div className='split'>
        This is the content of the split component.
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default Split                               // export the Split component elsewhere in the code.
```

<br>

## 6. Import the component.
React uses the keywords ```import``` and ```from``` to import a particular module or named parameter. In this case, since we have a custom component named "Split" in the composition file, we can import the component "Split" from the composition file route back in the src file (e.g ./) and then inside the composition file (e.g. ./composition/Split.js).
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  import Split from './composition/Split';           // import split from the composition file.


  function App() {
    return (
      <main className='App'>
        This is the content of the split component.
      </main>
    );
  }

  export default App;
```

<br>

## 7. Use the component in your file.
After you have imported the component to your file, you can freely use it as many times as you wish in the file by inserting the tag with the component name anywhere you wish. In this case, the "Split" component is being used in the main App component. Note that you could add as many component tags as you wish because since components are reusable. So if you added 6 instances of ```< Split />```, you would have 6 elements of "This is the content of the split component."

# How do coordinate CSS styles with components?

<dl>
<dd>

## 1. Create a .css file in the src folder.
When you use ```create-react-app``` when you setup your project, you have webpack enabled. Webpack lets you add CSS files specifically 
for each component you make. In this example, we are making a style sheet specifically for the App component. This is good because it 
is a seperation of concerns that allows you to focus on one section of styling at a time.
```
  src  >  App.css
```

<br>

## 2. Inside the new .css file, create your styling.
This stylization file is exactly the same as any normal css file. 
```css
  .App {                             
    display: flex;
    margin: 40px;
    min-height: calc(100vh - 80px);
  }
```

<br>

## 3. Import the .css file to the .js file you want to use it in.
Tp use the CSS stylization in your component file, you need to import it from its location in the directory. In this case, the 
App.css file is in the same folder (i.e. ./).Remember that webpack is going to add the styles to the browser when you import it 
to the JavaScript file.
```javascript
  import './App.css';
```

# How do make components configurable.
When You make a component configurable, you increase its potential for reuse by mixing both custom and standard props. In the example below, 
we pass props as a parameter and access the passed children from the props object to make the Split component versatile for any application. 

<dl>
<dd>

## 1. Create a .css file for the component stylization.
The first step in styling components (with props) is to create the stylesheet.
```css
  .split {
    flex: 1;
    padding: 1em;
  }
```

<br>

## 2. Add classNames to respective components.
In this example, the Split components have been expanded from a single tag to tags that have content nested inside of them. You can
insert the classNames inside these component tags.
```JavaScript
  function App() {
    return (
      <main className='App'>
        <Split className='left'>                // class name = left.
          Content for left panel.
        </Split>
        <Split className="right">               // class name = right.
          Content for right panel.
        </Split>
      </main>
    );
  }
```

<br>

## 3. Add the stylizations to your .css file.
For this step, you can either include your stylizations in a condensed stylesheet (i.e. App.css) or you can create a seperate stylesheet
and then import that stylesheet to the document you are using.
```css
    .App {
      display: flex;
      margin: 40px;
      min-height: calc(100vh - 80px);
    }

    .left {                                     // stylization for left column.
      background-color: darkslategray;
      color: azure;
    }

    .right {                                    // stylization for right column.
      background-color: wheat;
      color: firebrick;
    }
```

<br>

## 4. Setup the component for props.
In this step, you want to enable the "Split" component to show the content inside you other component (in this case App.js the the string 
"Content for left panel" and "Content for right panel". Those strings will be passed to the Split component via props and then when you 
call props.children, you will see the message.
```JavaScript
  function Split(props) {                                 // pass the props object.
    return (
      <div className='split'> 
        {props.children}                                  // and call the props.children.
      </div>
    );
  }
```

<br>

## 4. Make the component configurable.
Inside the split component you add code to read the props and create a new combined variable called "combinedClassName".
```JavaScript
  function Split(props) {
    const combinedClassName = `split ${props.className}`;      // Code reads props and create new className.
    return (
      <div className={combinedClassName}>                      // ... and call the new combinedClassName.
        {props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
```
