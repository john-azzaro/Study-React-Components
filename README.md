Here are a few questions from the study to explore:

# Why do you use components?
The advantage of using React components is that the are *reusable*. You can make a special component like a button, box, etc. and reuse them as many times as you want throughout your code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function.

# How do you create and use components?

## Create a composition file.
Assuming you have your React application setup and ready to go (e.g. create-react-app), the first thing you need to do is create "composition" file inside your source files folder. This file is going to house all of the components for the immediate study.
```
  src  >  composition  
```

<br>

## Create a component file in the composition folder.
Once you have the composition folder setup, you can put all of your component files inside. For this study, we want to create a component that splits the screen in two called "Split." 
```
  src  >  composition  >  Split.js
```

<br>

## In your component file, import React.
First, you need to make sure you import react so that you can use it inside your file.
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
```

<br>

## Create a function for your component.
In this case, we're going to create a component that "splits" a screen in two, so we should name it something that is intuitive like "Split".
```JavaScript
  function Split() {
    return (
      // code goes here.
    );
  }
```
