# Why do you use components?
The advantage of using React components is that the are *reusable*. You can make a special component like a button, box, etc. and reuse them as many times as you want throughout your code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function.

## Create a composition file.
Assuming you have your React application setup and ready to go (e.g. create-react-app), the first thing you need to do is create "composition" file inside your source files folder. This file is going to house all of the components for the immediate study.
```
  src  >  composition  
```

## Create a component file in the composition folder.
Once you have the composition folder setup, you can put all of your component files inside. For this study, we want to create a component that splits the screen in two called "Split." 
```
  src  >  composition  >  Split.js
