# React Components Study

# What is the React Component Study?
The React component Study is an examination of Components, functionality, and best practices.

Here are a few questions from the study to explore:

* [Why do you use components?](#Why-do-you-use-components)
* [How do you create and use components?](#How-do-you-create-and-use-components)
* [How do you style components?](#How-do-you-style-components)

# Why do you use components?
The advantage of using React components is that the are *reusable*. You can make a special component like a button, box, etc. and reuse them as many times as you want throughout your code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function.

# How do you create and use components?
To create and use basic components in your application, you simply need to follow the following process:

## 1. Create a composition file.
Assuming you have your React application setup and ready to go (e.g. create-react-app), the first thing you need to do is create "composition" file inside your source files folder. This file is going to house all of the components for the immediate study.
```
  src  >  composition  
```

<br>

## 2. Create a component file in the composition folder.
Once you have the composition folder setup, you can put all of your component files inside. For this study, we want to create a component that splits the screen in two called "Split." Remember that in the case of custom components, you always want to capitalize the first letter by convention.
```
  src  >  composition  >  Split.js
```

<br>

## 3. In your component file, import React.
First, you need to make sure you import react so that you can use it inside your file. To do this, you simply need to import React from the react dependency that which comes bundled with the ```create-react-app``` application installation.
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';                         // Import React for use inside file.
```

<br>

## 4. Create a function for your component.
The function you create is going to be the custom component you want to exort elsewhere in your code.  In this case, we're going to create a component that "splits" a screen in two, so we should name it something that is intuitive like "Split". Again, remember that since this is a custom component, you want to capitalize the first letter.
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  
  function Split() {                                 // Split component.
    return (
      <div className='split'>
        This is the content of the split component.
      </div>
    );
  }
```

<br>

## 5. Export the component for use in the app.
If you want to export your component for use elsewhere in your code, you need to export it. React uses the "export" keyowrd to export a particular module, named parameter, etc. To export the default export from a file, you follow the following syntax:
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  
  function Split() {
    return (
      <div className='split'>
        This is the content of the split component.
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default Split              // export the Split component elsewhere in the code.
```

<br>

## 6. Import the component.
React uses the keywords ```import``` and ```from``` to import a particular module or named parameter. In this case, since we have a custom component named "Split" in the composition file, we can import the component "Split" from the composition file route back in the src file (e.g ./) and then inside the composition file (e.g. ./composition/Split.js).
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  import Split from './composition/Split';    // import split from the composition file.


  function App() {
    return (
      <main className='App'>
        This is the content of the split component.
      </main>
    );
  }

  export default App;
```

<br>

## 7. Use the component in your file.
After you have imported the component to your file, you can freely use it as many times as you wish in the file by inserting the tag with the component name anywhere you wish. In this case, the "Split" component is being used in the main App component. Note that you could add as many component tags as you wish because since components are reusable. So if you added 6 instances of ```< Split />```, you would have 6 elements of "This is the content of the split component."
```JavaScript
  import React from 'react';
  import Split from './composition/Split';    


  function App() {
    return (
      <main className='App'>
        < Split />
      </main>
    );
  }

  export default App;
```

# How do you style components?

<br>

## Create a .css file in the src folder.
When you use ```create-react-app``` when you setup your project, you have webpack enabled. Webpack lets you add CSS files specifically 
for each component you make. In this example, we are making a style sheet specifically for the App component. This is good because it 
is a seperation of concerns that allows you to focus on one section of styling at a time.
```
  src  >  App.css
```
